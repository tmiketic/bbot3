It can be difficult to find pertinent information on breast cancer because of the plethora of resources available. This can be especially difficult for women from marginalized communities because of the lack of education available, for example, self-examination, screening, or treatment options. We wanted to create an easy to use platform for those overwhelmed with the available resources.

We decided that an optimal way to make this information accessible was to develop a chatbot. This way, each user has a personalized experience based on what they need, ranging from information on performing a proper self-test to finding breast cancer support groups in their area. Please interact with the chatbot on this webpage to see it in action!

Our team searched to find information from national breast cancer organizations to identify potential issues that could affect a person's understanding. Then we compiled information that would aid marginalized communities in finding screening locations and how to self-exam. Finally, a website was created to publish the pages of information with the accompaniment of a chatbot to help navigate through the website efficiently.

This project was built in less than two weeks for Girls In Tech Hackathon.

In order to run it locally, you need to have Ruby and Jekyll installed.
