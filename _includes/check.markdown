## How often should you perform a self-examination?  
Once a month   
 
## Where? 
In the shower, mirror, or lying down
  
## What to look for:
* A lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the underarm area
* A change in the size or shape of the breast
* Dimpling or puckering in the skin of the breast
* A nipple turned inward into the breast
* Discharge (fluid) from the nipple
* Scaly, red, or swollen skin on the breast, nipple, or areola (the dark area of skin at the center of the breast)

## Mammograms
### Where to get them? 
You may need a referral, which you can get from Planned Parenthood, where you can also get breast exams. This is the best option for most lower income families.
