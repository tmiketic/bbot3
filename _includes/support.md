## Support groups can be organized in different ways:  
* **Open membership:** Open membership means that members can come and go freely, and long-term commitment is not required. If you're going through treatment and your schedule isn't consistent, this may be the type of group for you.  
* **Closed membership:** Closed membership means that registration and commitment to a certain number of sessions is required. Once a specific number of people have signed up, the group is closed to new members. This helps members to establish consistency and to get to know each other better.
